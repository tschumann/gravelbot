Adding support for a new engine version:
- Create a new directory in gravelbot/
- cd into the new directory and git submodule add https://github.com/alliedmodders/hl2sdk.git
- cd hl2sdk and git checkout the branch for the new engine version

Working out method offsets
- There is information at https://wiki.alliedmods.net/Virtual_Offsets_(Source_Mods) and an online tool https://asherkin.github.io/vtable/ (currently the tool only supports a sub-set of games and doesn't seem to work in Chrome, but does work in Firefox).
