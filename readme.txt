== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Q. How do I build Gravelbot?
A. If you want to build it yourself, use a tagged release as the head of master can be unstable.
   Check out the project and run git submodule update --init --recursive to checkout the submodules (can take a while).
   On Windows open the gravelbot-2019.sln (the one in the directory for the game you want to play) with Visual Studio and compile it.
