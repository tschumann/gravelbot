About
=====
A bot for various Source engine games.

Playing
=======
Use one of the tagged releases if you want to play. The head of master is generally unstable.

You'll need to start the game with the -insecure command line option and possibly the -allowdebug command line option too for the plugin to load.

Offsets
=======
There is information at https://wiki.alliedmods.net/Virtual_Offsets_(Source_Mods) and an online tool https://asherkin.github.io/vtable/ (currently the tool only supports a sub-set of games and doesn't seem to work in Chrome, but does work in Firefox).
